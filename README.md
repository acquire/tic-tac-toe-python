# tic-tac-toe-python

A tic-tac-toe program written in python3. 

No installation required, just download and run it `$ python3 ttt.py`

Players pick either 'x' or 'o'. Game starts with player 'o'. Aim of the game is to get three in a row. 
Each player takes turns entering where they want their mark ('x' or 'o') to go by entering a number when prompted. 
The number entered corresponds to the position on the board. If a player gets three in a row,
a message is displayed and the game ends. If the board fills up and neither player has won, then it is a draw and the game ends.
